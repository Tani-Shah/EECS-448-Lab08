Exercise 3: Personal Profile

Make a profile page that is styled with CSS. Have fun with this. You can make a profile about anybody or anything. You are not required to make this about yourself or post any personal information online. This profile can be entirely fictional.

HTML Requirements:

	• Profile picture
  
	• Biographical paragraph
  
	• Hyperlinks to favorite web sites
  
	• Embedded YouTube video

CSS Requirements:
  
	• Use all the attributes listed in the CSS section at least once.
  
	• The page should not induce seizures or headaches - in other words, mind the color pallet you choose
  
	• All text should be easy to read


Exercise 4: CSS Manipulation

Create a web page that have a paragraph with some dummy text. Near the paragraph have text fields to accept the following values:

	• Border:
    
		o red value
    
		o green value
    
		o blue value
    
		o width
  
	• Background color:

		o green value
    
		o blue value

Finally, have a button that, when clicked, changes the border and background color to be as specified. You can use either the rgb() method or a color code, but you should tell the user what units they are in (00-FF or 0-255).
